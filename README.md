 // Exercise or Lab name: Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock

 // Description:  created Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock using html, css, and js with 2 pages; I implemented 2 game modes: 1vs1 or 1vCPU; each with 3 different modes: 1 win / 3 out of 5 / 4 out of 7. 

// Peer Review: George - Everything works except in the 1v1, the second players score doesn't update. I like the ui, the pictures are creative. ###(response by me AN): everything now corrected and should work perfectly fine.
